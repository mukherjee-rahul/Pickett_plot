# Pickett_plot
Implementation of interactive Pickett plot using in Rwa computation from Archie's law in wireline logging and formation evaluation.

Archie's equation: $Sw^n = \frac{aRw}{PHI^mRt}$

Where $Sw$ is the water saturation, $Rt$ is the true resistivity, and $PHI$ is the porosity. $a$, $m$, and $n$ are constants, usually $a=1$, $m=2$, and $n=2$.

Required libraries:
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy
- ipympl (required only for jupyter implementation)
