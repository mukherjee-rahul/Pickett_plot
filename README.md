# Pickett_plot
Implementation of interactive Pickett plot using in Rwa computation from Archie's law in wireline logging and formation evaluation.

Archie's equation:
$$Sw^n = \frac{a*Rw}{PHI^m*Rt}
 Where Sw is the water saturation. Rt is the true resistivity and PHI is the porosity. a,m and n are constants usually
 a=1,m=2 &n=2
